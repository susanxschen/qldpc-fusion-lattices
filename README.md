# qldpc-fusion-lattices

This repository contains all code, simulations and data/figures generated for the article **Fusion-based implementation of qLDPC codes with quantum emitters**.  It features a class which generates fusion-based quantum computing lattices to implement quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes, and simulation scripts to test small examples of Bivariate Bicycle (and Toric) code lattices with respect to phenomenological and physical noise models employing repeat-until-success strategies. 

## Usage
The following [variant of the union-find decoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15988) was used in the phenomenological simulations, refer to [this repository](https://github.com/nbi-hyq/uf_decoder) to find set-up instructions.  
Linux required (tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS).
